Hi, my name is Houman

I’m a tech enthusiast, aspiring to build a career in Information Security.

Head over to my blog, to read about my current antics and over to Homelab to see what I'm playing with at homeI’ll be sharing posts about my antics over on my blog; about my home lab, what I’m working on and learning about currently and from time to time, random things that peak my interest.

I’ve grown up in Melbourne, Australia and currently live abroad.
