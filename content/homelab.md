Welcome to my Home Lab

This is where I ~~break~~ learn new things as well as host a few services that I use.  
It’s still a work in progress but I’ve got the network topology down and how I’d like it to be set-up.

Currently I’m working on learning more about Firewalls, IDS, IPS and SIEMs as well as general sysadmin work and automating deployments.

An Open VPN servers is in the pipelines so I can access the lab remotely, as well as being able to share a few of the services with colleagues and friends.

Ideally I’d like to reach a stage where I can begin automating different elements of the lab and optimising my off site cloud services.

I’ll be making ~~regular~~ blog posts on my progress, so feel free to head over to [read more](https://whoishou.com/blog/)
